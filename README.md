# Titanic Dataset 

This Notebook demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict survival on the Titanic. The dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## Notebook Overview

The notebook contains two main sections:

1. **Default Model:** 
   - In this section, a machine learning model is trained using default parameter values.
   - Achieved accuracy: 86%.

2. **Fine-Tuning with Grid Search:**
   - This section demonstrates how to fine-tune the model using grid search to improve performance.
   - Achieved accuracy: 90%.

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells in each section sequentially.
